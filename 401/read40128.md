# Read: 28 - RecyclerView

## Create dynamic lists with RecyclerView

*** The Magic of the Recycler View is that You supply the data and define how each item looks, and the RecyclerView library dynamically creates the elements when they're needed.***

- Key Classes
  - RecyclerView is the ViewGroup that contains the views
  - Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`.
  - The `RecyclerView` requests those views, and binds the views to their data `RecyclerView.Adapter`.
  - The layout manager arranges the individual elements in your list, `LayoutManager` 
  
- RecyclerView Implemantion
  - Decide what the list or grid is going to look like
  - Design how each element in the list is going to look and behave,extending the `ViewHolder` Class , Your version of `ViewHolder` Provides all the Functionality for the lists items ,the view holder is being wrapped around a 'View',and Managed by 'RecyclerView'.
  - Defnine the 'Adapter' that associates the data 'ViewHolder' Views.

- Plan your layout
  -  the RecyclerView Items Arranged by a `LayoutManager` Class 
  - `LinearLayoutManager` arranges the items in a one-dimensional list.
  - GridLayoutManager arranges all items in a two-dimensional grid , *Vertically* OR *Horizontally* .
  - `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` Is Similar to `GridLayoutManager` , But it dosent Require that to the the items in a row . 
  
- The Adapter and View Holder Implemantation 
  - `onCreateViewHolder()` : `RecyclerView` calls this method whenever it needs to create a new `ViewHolder` , The method creates and initializes the ViewHolder and its associated View, but does not fill in the view's contentsâ€”the ViewHolder has not yet been bound to specific data.
  - `onBindViewHolder()` : `RecyclerView` calls this method to associate a `ViewHolder` with data. The method fetches the appropriate data and uses the data to fill in the view holder's layout. For example, if the `RecyclerView` displays a list of names, the method might find the appropriate name in the list and fill in the view holder's `TextView` widget.
  - `getItemCount()` : `RecyclerView` calls this method to get the size of the data set, The RecyclerView uses this to determine when there are no more items that can be displayed.
