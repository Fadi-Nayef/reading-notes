## Object-Orinted Programming Concepts :


1. **Inheritance**: Allow the Classe to be derived from other classes, which means that they inherit fields and methods from those classes 
    - many diffrent  objects having a certain amount in common with each other, but also defines additional features that make them different
 - The benifit Behind **(O.O.B)** is that allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes,when each class is allowed to have one direct `superClass`, and each `superClass` can have `subClasses`.
   - *Superclass* - class from which the subclass is derived
   - *Subclass* -  a class that is derived from another class

 - To Create a super Class , use the `extends ` method after the Class name at the Class declaration  , then call the class that you want to inherit

1.**interface** : method or more are created as interface which allow us to use the metod itself inthousand places without toutching the value of any other classes theyre using the same function in the same time.

1. **Pakages** : a namespace maniging a set of Classes and interfaces ,Looks like a folder .

1. **API** : Application Programming Interface, is a library containing many pakages , and these packages representing the tasks most commonly, associated with general-purpose programming.
    *  `String` object - has a state and behavior for character strings
    * `File` object - create, delete, inspect, compare, or modify a file in the filesystem
    *  `Socket` object - allows creation and use of network sockets
    * `GUI` objects - control buttons and checkboxes and any other thing related to graphical user interfaces
 
     - Object class - defines and implements behavior  to all classes, and defined in `java.lang` package. 
     - Object is the most general of all classes and at the top of the heirarchy. The classes at the bottom have a more specialized behavior.
     - Casting objects - casting shows the use of an object of one type in place of another type, among the objects permitted by inheritance and implementations

`You can prevent a method from being overridden by subclasses by declaring it as a final method`
