## Hibernate Many to Many

- This tutorial shows:- 
  - how the @ManyToMany annotation can be used for specifying this type of relationships in Hibernate.
  - Entity Relationship Diagram : which shows the many-to-many association between two entities. 
  - **Database Setup:-**
  - create database with the name spring_hibernate_many_to_many
  - create the employee and project tables along with the employee_project join table with employee_id and project_id as foreign keys.
  - Once that is done, you should be ready to preparation of the Maven dependencies and Hibernate configuration needs to be done.
  - Create a ***model classes*** with JPA annotations: the association between  between two classes refer to another, is bidirectional.
  - ** Execution** :  In order to map a many-to-many association, we  use the @ManyToMany, @JoinTable and @JoinColumn annotations.
* @ManyToMany annotation - is used in both classes to create the many-to-many relationship between the entities. This association has two sides i.e. the owning side and the inverse side.
* @JoinTable - is used to define the join/link table.
* @JoinColumn annotation - is used to specify the join/linking column with the main table.
* Execution - is writing a JUnit test
