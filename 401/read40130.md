# Read: 30 - Hash Tables

## Hash Tables

- `Hash` - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- `Bucket` - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- `Collisions` - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

##  Uses Of Hash Tables

- Hold unique values
- Dictionary
- Library

## Hashing

- Hash code turns a key into an integer.
- Hash codes are deterministic.
- Output is determined only by their input.
- Hash codes should never have randomness.
- The same key should always produce the same hash code.

## Applications

- Associative arrays.
- Database indexing.
- Caches.
- Object representation.
