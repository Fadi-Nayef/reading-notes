# SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design

## **SOLID** Stands For :-*

- **S** - Single Responsibilty Principle *SRP*.

    - means that , the class has to have only one job to do 
    
- **O** - Open / Closed Principle *OCP*.
    
    - Objects or entities should be open for extention but closed for modification 
    
    - a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself we *implemnt*
    
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle.
        
    - Any child type of a parent type should be able to stand in for that parent without things blowing-up.
        
    - If you have a class, Chef, with a makeChiken() method, then any subclass of Chef should be able to implement makeChiken()
    
- **I** - Interface segregation principle *ISP*.
        
    - You should favor many, smaller, client-specific interfaces over on larger, monolithic interface.

    
    **For Example:**  If you're going to some restaurant you'll find the menu 
    is fixed but the there's a special dish usually changes 
    
- **D** - Dependency Inversion principle *DIP*.
       
    -  **Abstraction** : The process of making something easier to understand by ignoring some of 
    the details that may be unimportant.
    
    **For Example:** If you're giving your friends directions 
    to your house, You wouldn't describe every house on the street, just that there are 5 houses on the street and yours is the last one.
