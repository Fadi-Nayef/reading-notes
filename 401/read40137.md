## S3 with Amplify

- `amplify add storage` , start provisioning storage
- `amplify push` , To push your changes to the cloud
- add libraries into the dependencies - Gradle Scripts, open build.gradle (Module: app).
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-storage-s3:1.24.0'
    // used to provide authentication for Amazon S3
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.24.0'
}
```
- `Amplify.addPlugin()` To initialize the Amplify Auth and Storage categories  , `Amplify.configure()` To complete initialization.
Add to `onCreate()` Method

Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSS3StoragePlugin());
```

    Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
            "ExampleKey",
            exampleFile,
            result -> Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Successfully uploaded: " + result.getKey()),
            storageFailure -> Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", storageFailure)
