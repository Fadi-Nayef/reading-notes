# Java Imports

Package declaration
The first statement, other than comments, in a Java source file, must be the package declaration.

Following the optional package declaration, you can have import statements, which allow you to specify classes from other packages that can be referenced without qualifying them with their package.

Default package. Altho all Java classes are in a directory, it's possible to omit the package declaration. For small programs it's common to omit it, in which case Java creates what it calls a default package. Sun recommends that you do not use default packages.

# Java Loops

## Types of loops
for: repeat certain operation by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter
for (initialization; Boolean-expression; step) statement; Let's see it in a simple example:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { System.out.println("Simple for loop: i = " + i); }

for-each
While: most fundamental, repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true
Do-While: works like While except the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop
